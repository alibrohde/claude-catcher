# anthropic-changelog-watch

Anthropic ships constantly. This is how I stopped missing it.

Fork this repo. Hand it to Claude Code with one prompt. Twenty minutes later you get an email every time Anthropic adds a Claude Code release, an SDK release, a news post, or an engineering-blog post. Silent when nothing ships.

No servers. No cost. Runs on GitHub Actions. 100-ish lines of Python.

## What you get

- An email in your inbox every time something new appears on:
  - [Claude Code `CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
  - [Anthropic Python SDK `CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
  - [anthropic.com/news](https://www.anthropic.com/news)
  - [anthropic.com/engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering)
- A quiet weekly heartbeat so you know the watcher is still alive when nothing ships.
- No LLM calls in the loop. Dedup is a sha256 check against a committed `state.json` — deterministic, auditable, free.

## Setup (for vibe coders)

1. **Fork this repo** (button top-right on GitHub).
2. **Clone your fork locally** and `cd` into it.
3. **Open Claude Code in the repo directory.**
4. **Paste the prompt in [SETUP_PROMPT.md](SETUP_PROMPT.md)** into Claude. It will ask you the two or three questions it genuinely needs and handle the rest.

That's it. Claude will ask you whether you have personal Gmail or Google Workspace, then walk you through the two-or-three-minute credential dance for whichever you have. When the first run succeeds you'll get a "watcher is live" email.

## What the setup actually does

- Sets these GitHub Actions secrets in your fork: `GMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_TO`, and either `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` (personal Gmail) or `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` + `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` + `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` (Workspace).
- Triggers the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/watch.yml`), which runs every 2 hours on GitHub's infrastructure. Your laptop can be closed; the watcher doesn't care.
- On the first run it records the current state of the four sources as a baseline and sends one confirmation email. From then on you only hear from it when something actually changes.

## Sources

| Source | Kind | Parser |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | GitHub raw CHANGELOG.md | `changelog_md` |
| Anthropic Python SDK | GitHub raw CHANGELOG.md | `changelog_md` |
| Anthropic news | HTML link index (`/news/<slug>`) | `link_index` |
| Anthropic engineering | HTML link index (`/engineering/<slug>`) | `link_index` |

Add more in [watch.py](watch.py) — append to `SOURCES`. Two kinds supported: `changelog_md` (raw markdown where `## heading` entries are items) and `link_index` (HTML page where links follow a `/<prefix>/<slug>` pattern).

## Email paths

The script picks its email backend by which secrets are set:

- **`GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` set** → SMTP to `smtp.gmail.com:465` with that app password. Simplest; works with any Google account that has 2-Step Verification on. Gets blocked on some Workspace tenants.
- **`GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` set** → Gmail API via OAuth, refreshing an access token on every run. Works on Workspace tenants that block app passwords. Run [tools/get_refresh_token.py](tools/get_refresh_token.py) once to generate the refresh token from your own Google Cloud OAuth client.

If neither is set, the run fails with a clear error.

## Running locally

```bash
export GMAIL_USER="you@gmail.com"
export EMAIL_TO="you@gmail.com"
export GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="abcd efgh ijkl mnop"  # or the OAuth triple
python3 watch.py
```

Or just use the workflow — go to your fork's **Actions** tab, pick "watch", click **Run workflow**.

## Why this exists

Anthropic's changelog, release notes, and engineering blog are four separate surfaces, all of which ship fast. Anyone building on top — vibe coders, agent hackers, founders shipping AI-native products — pays a tax to keep up manually. A cron + diff + email pipeline solves it, but "set up a cron + diff + email pipeline" isn't something most people want to do on a Tuesday night. So here's the pipeline, pre-built; hand it to Claude to wire into your accounts.
